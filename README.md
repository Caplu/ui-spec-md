## UI Flow codeblock

When you make UI documentation, you may need to have UI Flows Graph

UI Spec MD arrows to contain special code blocks to draw UI Flows with markdown friendly easy syntax.
Here is a markdown example with the code block for UI Flows.

	---
	title: doc title
	screen: ./screen1.png?highlight=[[216,193,150,70],[720,140,130,50]]
	---

	Write docs with markdown.
	You can also contain uiflow code block.

	```uiflow
	[What the user sees]
	What they do
	==> What the user sees 2

	[What the user sees 2]
	What they do A
	==> What the user sees 3
	What they do B
	==> What the user sees 4
	```

	| awesome | table |
	| ---     | ---   |
	| data    | data  |


Here is the complied result example.

  gulp.src( './src/**/*.md' )
      .pipe( uiSpecMd( { srcRoot: __dirname + '/src/' } ) )
      .pipe( gulp.dest('./build/' ) );
